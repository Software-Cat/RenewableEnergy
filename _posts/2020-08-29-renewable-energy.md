# Pros

## Low Greenhouse Emmisions

Renewable energy sources don't rely on combustion to generate power, thus t

## Naturally Replenished

Renewable energy sources are naturally replenished by cycles of the Earth, so there is no risk of running out, as long as the natural cycles don't stop. Natural cycles are driven by solar energy, which would continue normally for millions of years to come.

# Cons

## Low Capacity

Renewable enrgy sources often generate less energy per time unit (Wattage) than their non-renewable counterparts, hence it is impossible for them to meet the demand in peak usage times. Non-renewable sources are often used to supplent demand in this case

## Seasonality

Renewable energy sources often depend on environmental factors like season and time in their power output; solar panels don't work at night and wind farms don't work without wind. It is necessary to built large battery banks to store the energy when not enogh is being generated.

## Location Dependency

Renewable energy can only be harvested in specific locations, hence its generation is highly dependent on the productivity of the land. For example, hydroelectric dams can only be built near large reservoirs of water, wind farms are only effective in wind tunnels, and geothermal energy only works in geologically active hotspots.
